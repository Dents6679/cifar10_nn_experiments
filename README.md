# What is this Repository?
This repository contains a python notebook for an investigation on CNNs hyperparameter and architecture choices over the CIFAR-10 Dataset.  

## Where's the code?
All of the important code and markdown cells for this project can be found in the `246518.ipynb` notebook.
It's formatting is quite bizzare due to the specification of the project, but it still does a good job at showcasing my coding style.

Enjoy!

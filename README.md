# Exploring Convolutional Neural Networks with CIFAR-10

In this project, I explored the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. With 50,000 training and 10,000 testing images spanning ten classes, CIFAR-10 is a crucial benchmark in computer vision and has driven advancements in neural network techniques.

I developed a baseline CNN model and conducted experiments to optimize its performance. The key areas of investigation included:

- Learning Rate Optimization: Tested various learning rates and implemented a custom learning rate scheduler.
- Dropout Implementation: Evaluated the impact of dropout on model performance and generalization.
- Gradient Flow Analysis: Examined the network's gradient flow with and without dropout, assessing the effect of batch normalization on performance.

The experiments yielded significant insights, with the best-performing model achieving a test set loss value of 0.675 using a static learning rate and batch normalization. This project not only strengthened my understanding of CNN architectures but also expanded my portfolio with practical experience in machine learning and model optimization.
